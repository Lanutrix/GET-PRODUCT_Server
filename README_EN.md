## üí° Concept

We wanted to create a mobile application that would assist people with allergies. To make it useful for both disabled individuals and healthy people. Our application is a voice assistant that will become a reliable helper in choosing safe products.

## üîß Key Features:

- Product scanning: Simply take a photo of the product packaging with your device's camera, and the application automatically analyzes the composition using text recognition and a special algorithm.

- User preferences request: Users can specify in the application which additives or ingredients they are allergic to or want to avoid.

- Voice verdict: After analyzing the product composition, the application vocalizes the scanning result, informing the user whether the product is safe for consumption. This is especially useful for visually impaired and disabled individuals who may have difficulty reading small print on packaging.

## ‚≠ê Advantages:

- Convenience: A simple and intuitive interface makes the application accessible to a wide range of users.
- Safety: Helps prevent unintended consumption of allergens or harmful additives.
- Inclusivity: Specially designed to meet the needs of people with various restrictions and characteristics.

GetProduct - your personal assistant in choosing safe products, which will help you make informed decisions about your diet.
